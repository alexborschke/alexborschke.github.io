[Global Solid Waste Emissions 2015-2021](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalSolidWasteEmissions2015-2021/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
<br>
<p style="font-size: 12px">In this Python-based project, I built regression models to analyse relationships between two pairs of variables: country's population & solid waste emissions quantity / country's GDP per capita & Waste Management indicator (how well a country recycles waste on a scale from 0 to 100). Using a k-means clustering algorithm, I also determined how data values of these two variable pairs form groupings. A geospatial analysis resulted in two rankings of the world countries: one that ranks countries according to their total emissions produced from solid waste, and another that ranks countries according to total solid waste emissions per capita.</p>
  
<p style="font-size: 12px"><b>Analytical techniques:</b> data cleaning and manipulation, EDA, correlation and regression analysis, hypothesis testing, cluster analysis with k-means, geospatial analysis, data visualization in Python and Tableau. </p>

[Instacart - sales and customer behavior analysis](https://github.com/alexborschke/PYTHON_INSTACART_PROJECT)
<br>
<p style="font-size: 12px"> Having analyzed several data sets in Python, I identified the busiest days and hours, price ranges and the most popular departments for an online grocery store. I also created customer profiles based on features such as brand loyalty, demographic info, order frequency, family status, regions, and other. On the basis of the analysis results, I gave recommendations to the marketing and sales departments regarding the upcoming marketing campaign to improve customer loyalty and boost sales. </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px"><b>Analytical techniques:</b> descriptive statistics, distibution, correlation, new variable derivation, data aggregation, population flow, data visualization in Python.</p>

[Rockbuster Stealth](https://public.tableau.com/views/RockbusterStealthOnlineStreamingServiceLaunch/StoryboardRockbuster?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
<br>
<p style="font-size: 12px"> In this SQL-based project, I helped the BI department of a fictional video rental company "Rockbuster Stealth" with a launch strategy for the new online video service. I conducted an EDA and described patterns in the data, such as the average rental rate, revenue, number of active customers, etc. I determined the top 10 countries and cities with the highest number of customers in 2006, the top 10 countries with the highest revenue, the 5 most loyal customers in 2006, and the most popular film genres in 2006. I gave recommendations regarding price policy, market expansion, and loyalty programs.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px"><b>Analytical techniques:</b> data cleaning and manipulation, joining tables, using CTEs and subqueries in SQL, data visualization in Tableau.</p>

[Preparing for influenza season in the US 2018](https://public.tableau.com/views/PreparingforinfluenzaseasoninUS2018/StoryboardInfluenza?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
<br>
<p style="font-size: 12px"> To help US hospitals overcome the upcoming influenza season of 2018, I determined the seasonality of influenza and predicted when it will occur in 2018, I determined specific characteristics of the vulnerable population, and which US states have the highest numbers of vulnerable population. Based on these results, I gave recommendations to hospitals and medical agencies when and where to send more medical staff and which preparatory actions to undertake outside the influenza season.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px"><b>Analytical techniques:</b> data cleaning and manipulation, statistical hypothesis testing, forecasting, data visualization in Tableau and Excel.</p>

[GameCo - analyzing global video game market trends](/pdf/Final Project Presentation for GameCo.pdf)
<br>
<p style="font-size: 12px"> The goal of this project was to foster, with the help of a descriptive analysis, a better understanding of how GameCoâ€™s (a fictitious video game company) new games might fare in the market. I determined global and regional trends in video game sales, regional markets with current rapid growth, and popular video game genres and platforms. I gave recommendations for the development of the company on the following three markets: Japan, North America, and Europe.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px"><b>Analytical techniques:</b> data cleaning and manipulation, deriving new variables, descriptive analysis, data visualization in Excel.</p>
